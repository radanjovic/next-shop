# NextShop app

Simple shop app with Next.js. This app uses mongodb for storage and tailwind for styles. The app has it's own custom mini admin panel where admin can browse orders, create new products and edit existing products. Admin login is a dummy login. Users can browse products, add them to cart and order them.

## Run 

After replacing my credentials (mongodb) with your own, run:

```js
npm i
npm run dev
```
